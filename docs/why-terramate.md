# Why Terramate

This page describes existing approaches to managing cloud infrastructure as code and compares those with what we call
the "next generation" Infrastructure as Code approach that we provide with Terramate.

## Introduction

Adopting, managing and automating Infrastructure as Code is a time-consuming,
costly and error-prone process. Currently, two approaches exist:

## The "Do it yourself" approach ðŸ’¥

This approach describes teams that built a platform around IaC tools such as Terraform and OpenTofu. This approach often
leads to a combination of dozens of tools that solve different problems in automation, collaboration, security, observability,
etc. Following this approach requires dedicated product teams that glue all those tools into an often fragile platform
that doesn't scale.

## The "Purpose Built CI/CD" approach ðŸ¤‘

This approach is often referred to as "TACOS"â€”Terraform Automation and Collaboration tools. These purpose-built CI/CD platforms
come with a heavy price tag, are time-consuming to onboard and manage, and usually require refactoring your existing IaC
architectures into specific patterns. Using a dedicated CI/CD platform also requires you to grant these platforms broad access to your cloud accounts and state files that often contain sensitive information.

## The "Terramate" approach ðŸ’«

We designed  Terramate because we believe organizations such as yours spent too much time building either by building
proprietary platforms or by buying purpose-built CI/CD platforms.

- cheap
- secure
- allows you to stay in your native iac
- scalable
- multi repo
- any command
- none intrusive
- fast, scalable
- allows you to work native
