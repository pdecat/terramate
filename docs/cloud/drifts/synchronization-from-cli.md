# Synchronize Drift Checks from CLI

To display deployments on Terramate Cloud, we need to synchronize the status and details.

When already using [Terramate CLI](../../introduction.md) to orchestrate your stacks, the configuration needed to synchronize deployments is minimal.

You can synchronize deployments using [`terramate run`](../../cli/cmdline/run.md) or reduce the overhead on the caller side by using [Terramate Scripts](../../cli/orchestration/scripts.md), e.g. `terramate script run` where you can trigger deployment sync automatically.

## Required Permission

To run the command on the local machine `terramate cloud login` needs to be executed before.
When run in CI/CD, Terramate CLI will pick up the OpenID Connect (OIDC) tokens and authenticate to the cloud.

To gather metadata from GitHub about the pull request associated with the preview, a `GITHUB_TOKEN` needs to be exposed or a valid GitHub CLI configuration needs to be available.

## `terramate run`

The [run](../../cli/cmdline/run.md) command in Terramate CLI offers some command line options to synchronize drift status information to Terramate Cloud.

- `--cloud-sync-drift-status` Synchronizes the drift status and logs to Terramate Cloud
- `--cloud-sync-terraform-plan=FILE` A Terraform integration that allows synchronization of details about the changed, added or deleted Terraform Resources that were planned and define the drift between code and cloud.

::: tip
Use the following command to synchronize the full status of your stacks to Terramate Cloud.
Ensure that you are also authenticated with your CI/CD e.g. GitHub to collect all metadata.
:::

The full command line to run a drift check looks like the following:

```bash
terramate run \
  --cloud-sync-drift-status \
  --cloud-sync-terraform-plan=out.tfplan \
  --continue-on-error \
  terraform plan -outfile out.tfplan
```

It is recommended to create a Terramate Script as explained in the next section, to provide an easy interface for users that can be used on local machines the same way as in CI/CD automated environments.
This way the options do not need to be added and memorized.

In case communication with Terramate Cloud fails, the drift check will continue as expected but the drift details might not be fully synchronized with Terramate Cloud.
Warning messages will help you identify any problems.
